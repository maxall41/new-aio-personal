This is a modified protocol for transfecting DNA into BL21 E. coli or other strains of E. coli. It is based off of [this](<(https://github.com/thethoughtemporium/Protocols/blob/main/Transformations/bl21%20transformation.md)>) protocol from the Thought Emporium, but with a few minor changes such as replacing LB broth media with SOC media for recovery after transfection.

## Materials

- distilled water

- sterile 15ml tubes

- sterile 1.5ml tubes

- calcium chloride

- syringe + syringe filter

- LB broth

- LB agar plate + appropriate antibiotic

- S.O.C media

- Innoculation loop

- Sterile spreader

- Pipettes/tips

- 15ml centrifuge

- 1.5ml centrifuge

- heat block

- Ice bath

- shaking/rotating incubator

## Stock prep

1. Prepare a 1M calcium chloride solution by dissolving 1.1g in 10ml of water

2. transfer 1ml of this solution to a fresh tube and add 9ml of distilled water

3. filter sterilize into a fresh tube.

4. Label the result "transformation buffer"

5. For improved results, prechill this buffer in the fridge for at least an hour before use

## Day 1

1. The day before performing the transformation protocol, innoculate 10ml of LB broth in a 15ml tube with BL21 cells, or any other ecoli variety

2. place into rotating/shaking incubator at 37C and let grow overnight

## Day 2

1. Innoculate 10ml of fresh LB with 100ul of overnight solution

- Let grow for exactly 2H (do not let overgrow)

2. Pellet cells by centrifugation at 5000rpm for 2-3 minutes

3. Decant off liquid and resuspend pellet in 1ml transformation buffer

4. Transfer liquid to 1.5ml tube

5. Pellet cells at 10000rpm for 45 - 60 seconds

6. Pipette off liquid, do not disutrb pellet

7. Add 1ml of transformation buffer and resuspend by pipetting gently

8. Pellet again at 10000rpm for 45 - 60 seconds

9. Pipette off liquid

10. The pellet should contain enough cells for 3-4 reactions. Add 100ul of transformation buffer for the number of reactions you wish to perform (100-400ul)

- If doing more than 1 reaction, seperate liquid into 100ul aliqotes in seperate tubes

11. Add 50-400ng of DNA to each tube (50 for easy plasmids/strains, 400 for stubborn ones. Adjust as needed)

12. incubate mixutre in a fridge (5C) for 25 min

13. Preheat hot plate/water bath to 42C

14. After incubation in the fridge heat shock cells in heat block for exactly 90s

15. immeditaly chill in ice bath after heat shocking for 3-5 min

16. Add 1ml of fresh S.O.C media to each tube, and allow to recover in an incubator at 37C for 1-2H with shaking/rotation (if S.O.C media is not available. This can be substituted with LB broth, but will result in lower transformation efficiency)

### If using turbo or other easy strains:

1. plate 100ul of recovered solution on appropriate antibiotic or selection plates

2. spread using sterile spreader or innoculation loops

### If using BL21:

1. Pellet cells by centrifugation at 10000rpm for 20s

2. plate entire pellet + 100ul of media

3. spread using sterile spreader or innoculation loop

17. Incubate plate at 37C for 2-3 days until colonies develop
