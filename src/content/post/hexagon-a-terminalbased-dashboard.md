Recently I made a terminal-based dashboard called Hexagon. I didn't like using a browser to access my self-hosted applications
but I still wanted the features they provided. So I made my own dashboard. It's pretty easy to use it has a server and a client the server holds the configuration
for authentication, status indicators, and apps. The client just allows you to view them in an easy-to-use API but if you wanted to you can create your client or server for it because the entire project is open-source.
